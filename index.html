      <div id="tribute-info"> The Champions League. The most viewed club sporting event with over 380 million watchers every year. 32 European teams take the field in September until a winner is crowned in May. Unexpected results and upsets. Twists and turns. Joy and despair. Pragmatism and flair. Absolute mayhem all to the soundrack of the famous Champions League anthem. An unparalleled spectacle that truly validates the nickname of the 'The Beautiful Game'.
        <p id="key-facts">Key facts:
        <ul id="list">
          <li>The Champions League was introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens, although more commonly known as the European Cup</li>
          <li>The competition was rebranded in 1992 as the Champions League and was expanded to allow more teams than just the just the winners of the domestic European leagues.</li>
          <li>UEFA is the competitions governing body and retains the offical trophy at all times and only small-scale replicas are given for each winner to display.</li>
          <li>However, a full-size replica is granted to teams who have won 3 in a row or 5 overall. Only 6 clubs have earned this right: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan, Liverpool, and Barcelona.</li>
          <li> Real Madrid have won the most titles with 14, double the amount of A.C Milan who are second on the list.
            <li> Cristiano Ronaldo is the CL's highest-ever goalscorer with 141 goals, followed by Lionel Messi with 125.</li>
        </ul>
